# CartPole RL Solution Summary

## Implementation Progress

1. **Initial Implementation (DQN Agent)**
   - Created a Deep Q-Network (DQN) implementation for solving the CartPole problem
   - Used experience replay buffer to store and sample transitions
   - Implemented target network for stable learning
   - Applied epsilon-greedy policy with decay for exploration-exploitation balance
   - Configured with initial hyperparameters: hidden size = 128, learning rate = 0.001, epsilon decay = 0.995
   - Set up comprehensive logging system to track progress

2. **Logging System Improvement**
   - Modified the logging system to append to log file instead of overwriting
   - Added script identifier to differentiate logs from different runs
   - Implemented session separation with timestamps
   - Made logging more informative with detailed metrics

3. **Success Criterion Update**
   - Updated the success criterion from 195.0 to 487.5 average reward over 100 episodes
   - This made the problem much more challenging, requiring the agent to balance longer

4. **Seed Management**
   - Modified all scripts to use random seeds by default (based on timestamp)
   - Added command-line arguments to specify custom seeds for reproducibility
   - Implemented different seeds for each experiment configuration

5. **Hyperparameter Experimentation**
   - Tested four different configurations:
     - Baseline: Hidden size = 128, learning rate = 0.001, epsilon decay = 0.995
     - Deeper Network: Hidden size = 256, learning rate = 0.001, epsilon decay = 0.995
     - Faster Epsilon Decay: Hidden size = 128, learning rate = 0.001, epsilon decay = 0.98
     - Higher Learning Rate: Hidden size = 128, learning rate = 0.005, epsilon decay = 0.995

6. **Visualization Tool**
   - Created a visualization script to observe the trained agent's behavior
   - Added option to specify number of episodes and custom seed

## Results

### Initial Success Criterion (avg score ≥ 195.0):
- All configurations successfully solved the environment
- Typical solution occurred within 100 episodes
- Agents achieved stable performance with scores frequently reaching 500 (maximum possible)

### Updated Success Criterion (avg score ≥ 487.5):
- None of the configurations fully solved the environment with the stricter criterion
- Best performance from the Deeper Network configuration (416.66 average)
- Higher Learning Rate configuration showed promise (372.09 average)
- Faster Epsilon Decay also performed well (357.19 average)
- Baseline configuration showed lower performance (250.84 average)

## Observations

1. **Learning Stability**: 
   - All configurations showed some instability in later episodes
   - Loss values occasionally spiked to very large numbers
   - Performance sometimes degraded after initially reaching high scores

2. **Network Size Impact**:
   - The deeper network (256 neurons) consistently outperformed the baseline
   - Suggests that additional representational capacity helps with this task

3. **Learning Rate Effect**:
   - Higher learning rate (0.005) showed faster initial learning
   - But also showed more volatility in performance

4. **Exploration Strategy**:
   - Faster epsilon decay reached exploitation phase more quickly
   - Performed better than baseline but not as well as deeper network

## Future Improvements

1. **Network Architecture**:
   - Test even deeper networks or different architectures (e.g., dueling DQN)
   - Experiment with different activation functions

2. **Advanced Algorithms**:
   - Implement Double DQN to reduce overestimation bias
   - Try Prioritized Experience Replay to focus on important transitions
   - Explore policy gradient methods as alternatives to Q-learning

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Perform more systematic grid search or random search
   - Use learning rate schedules instead of fixed values
   - Try different reward discount factors (gamma)

4. **Reward Engineering**:
   - Modify the reward function to encourage better balancing
   - Add penalties for extreme cart positions or velocities

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Implement more comprehensive evaluation metrics
   - Analyze failure modes more systematically
